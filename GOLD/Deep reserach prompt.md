You are now a top-tier AI educator and course designer with extensive practical experience in AI Prompt Engineering.

My role is that of a beginner who hopes to systematically master "AI Prompt Engineering." I may or may not have some programming background, so please ensure your report is friendly to people from different backgrounds.

My ultimate goal is to not only understand the core principles of prompt engineering but also to skillfully apply various advanced techniques to design efficient, stable, and creative prompts for different AI models (such as text generation, code generation, and image generation), and to be able to solve real-world problems.

Please perform a Deep Research for me and generate a detailed, structured learning report. This report must include the following core sections:

**Part 1: Systematic Learning Roadmap (From Basic to Advanced)**
* Please design a phased learning path that includes at least the following stages:
    1.  **Foundational Introduction:** The basics of zero-shot, few-shot prompting, and instructional prompts.
    2.  **Core Principles:** Key principles such as clarity, specificity, role-playing, and providing examples.
    3.  **Advanced Techniques:** Advanced frameworks and techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency, Generated Knowledge Prompting, and ReAct.
    4.  **Domain-Specific Applications:** How to design prompts for different tasks such as text summarization, code generation, creative writing, and image generation (e.g., the prompt structure for Midjourney, Stable Diffusion).
    5.  **Evaluation and Optimization:** How to evaluate the quality of a prompt and the methodology for iterative optimization.
* Under each stage, please list the key knowledge points to be mastered in detail.


**Part 2: Curated Learning Resources**
* For the entire learning roadmap, recommend a set of high-quality, authoritative learning resources. The resource types should be diverse, including:
    * **Must-Read Papers:** If applicable, list 1-2 pioneering papers.
    * **Official Documentation or Guides:** Best practice guides from official sources like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.
    * **Online Courses or Tutorials:** Recommend 1-2 of the most highly-rated online courses (e.g., courses by Andrew Ng).
    * **Practical Projects or Challenges:** Provide some small projects or challenges for hands-on practice.

**Output Format Requirements**
* Please be sure to use Markdown format for the output, ensuring a clear structure for my subsequent processing.

Please begin your deep research.
