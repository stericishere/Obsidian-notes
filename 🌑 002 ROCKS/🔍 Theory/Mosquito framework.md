## Mosquito framework:
> <u>Do you know during raining, the weight of a raindrop is about 50 times of a Mosquito</u>
> <u>Similar to a truck hitting you</u>
> <u>So how can most of the Mosquitos be able to survive during raining?</u>
> 	When the raindrop hit the wings or legs of the Mosquitos
> 	the Mosquitos will tilt to the side and roll sideway allowing the raindrop to pass thro
> 	> Mosquitos are covered in hydrophobic material over its body just like a leaf, 
> 	The Mosquitos will also align with raindrop and fall alongside to absorb the power
> No matter how hard you hit the Mosquitos, it always survive cuz it knows how to go with the flow
