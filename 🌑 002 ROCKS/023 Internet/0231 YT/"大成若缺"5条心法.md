# "大成若缺"5条心法
>Links:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXOv4Vafvh4

## ✨内容概述:
<u>Great achievement always seems incomplete</u>
The most powerful things are often not perfect or showy, but humble and resilient.

## Da Vinci
- The main flews about Da Vinci is that he procrastinate and leaving things incomplete 
> It took him 3 year to draw the "Last Supper", and most of the time, he wasnt even drawing. 
> He always be staring at the wall for a day whole and not touch anything, Sometimes he seems crazy running into the church just to add a touch for someone clothes
<u>But it's because of his accomplishments and ability is too overwhelming</u>
> His brain doesn't only think of the painting
> 1. To draw a horse, he need to dissect multiple horse
> 2. To draw a light, he need to figure the physic behind optics
> 3. To draw a smile, he need to figure facial nerve and human physiology
> <u>He's not only trying catch a smile, he trying to capture a moment in life</u>
> <u>- His mind, his brain is simulating the whole moment while canvas is finite</u>
> <u>- And it's  impossible to put a universe into a finite canvas</u>
> That's why his is procrastinating cuz if he doesnt finish a painting then it's still possible for him to research and simulate the whole universe into a canvas

## Zeng Guofan’s Tactics:
He deliberately left a project incomplete to get others involved, turning a potential weakness into collective strength and success.
> if he completes all by himself, then the responsibility is only on him, 
> if he made it, then everyone will pray on your downfall cuz they jealous
> if he fails, then everyone will step on your downfall
> Therefore, when he's at 90%, he left 10% for other to complete so that everyone else is involved in the project and he wont be the only one

## Using it in real life:
You finish 90% of a project, 
> <u>And you leave its details for other to discuss</u>
> "My thought is that... However in terms of details I'm still hesitated about to the choice of A or B, so I'd love to hear you thought"

## Be water
- <u>What is humble </u>
> Willingness of being in the position or work that no one else want to be
- <u>What is be /nevol /ence 仁愛</u>
> Be genuine while helping others, either not do it or do it 100%
- <u>Honesty</u>
> Do what you promised (including time!!)
- <u>Fair</u>
> While working, treat everyone the same, dont put emotion 
- <u>Wisdom</u>
> Look at the waves and ride with the waves

## Practical Wisdom (“Five Heart Methods”)
1. **Start with 60%:** 
	>Don’t let perfectionism stop you; begin with what you have.
2. **Leave 20% Blank**: 
	>Reserve energy and space for flexibility, creativity, and resilience.
3. **Practice “Clumsy” Persistence**: 
	>Real skill comes from consistent, honest effort, not shortcuts.
4. **Regularly Clear Out**: 
	>Periodically let go of clutter (mental, physical, emotional) for resetting.
5. **Let Light In Through Cracks**: 
	>Embrace and use your flaws—they are sources of unique strengths.
