## Example:
> [!question] Tell me about a time you solved a difficult problem.
> <u>Context:</u>
> - <u>What's ur position in it?</u>
> 	>At a SaaS startup, I led a <u>strategic project</u> to develop a smart recommendation feature in partnership with a B2B fintech company.
> - <u>What happened?</u><p align="left"></p>
> 	>It was our first collaboration
> - <u>Why is it difficult?</u><p align="left"></p>
> 	>Due to misaligned expectations and integration challenges, the project was already two months behind schedule when I took over. The delay put our product roadmap at risk and raised serious concerns from the client.
> 
> <u>Action:</u>
> - <u>What dis you do?</u>
> >To get the project back on track, I took three key steps:
> > - Identify problem:
> > >I diagnosed the root issues by leading a cross-functional audit with engineering, UX, and sales. We identified that data format mismatches and restricted API permissions were the main blockers.
> > - How you address problem
> >I restructured the release plan by breaking the feature into two phases. I prioritized delivering the core recommendation engine first, while deferring advanced features to phase two ensuring we could ship value sooner.
> > 
> >I streamlined client collaboration by initiating direct tech-to-tech meetings and setting up a shared Kanban board to track milestones and reduce delays caused by email communication.
> 
> <u>Result:</u>
> 
> <u>Learning</u>
> > This experience reinforced the importance of early risk detection, agile reprioritization, and transparent communication in recovering delayed projects. It also strengthened my cross-functional leadership and stakeholder management skills under pressure.
