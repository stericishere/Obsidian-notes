_“You are 42% more likely to achieve your goals, simply by writing them down on a regular basis.”_

1. **What the most IMPORTANT Thing I've done today**
	> I went to my last pool dive for my license
2. **What do I need to stop doing and start doing?**
	> I need to sleep early and wake up earlier, I need to make connection with things that i wanted in life, even little one. For example I can play piano everyday for 5 mins instead of only playing once in a while. I only need to start it and touch it once a day
	> > I think I dont really respected my plan. I need to follow my plans to achieve what I want to do (so what do i actually want to do? maybe spend some time think about it)
3. **What Im grateful for?**
	> I think I dont really respected my plan. I need to follow my plans to achieve what I want to do (so what do i actually want to do? maybe spend some time think about it)
4. **How can I make TMR even better?**
	> make a plan that i follow, and I respect my time more. Oh shoot my tattooo
5. **Top 3 priority TMR??**
	> Apply for 2 position, hackathon and UTMIST, and apply for one job, finish craftting my profoilo
	> Finished the generative AI project first then we resume to AI play games
