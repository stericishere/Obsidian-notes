ye that's a good point, but what’s interesting with the paper is that they’re not doing approximation for lower rank matrix, but more of a post-training replacement of less critical attention blocks. So there’s no retraining overhead that need fine-tuning to stabilize the performance. I wonder if the two could actually be complementary, maybe PostNAS could even learn which layers are safe for low-rank insertion without hurting performance
