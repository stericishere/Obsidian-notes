# Nature (Physis) vs. Convention (Nomos)

## ❓ What is it about？
> **Natural things are universal and innate** (普世的), like the need to eat when hungry, as one would starve otherwise.

> **Conventional things are human-made agreements** (人為建構出來的), such as specific cuisines like ramen or Michelin-starred meals. 
> These are "false needs" (假需求) "rolled out" by society

> So the need is created by human, not natural "need"/"desire" from nature
>
