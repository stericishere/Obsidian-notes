# Cynicism:
**A low-desire, minimalist lifestyle**
## ❓ What is it about？
Cynicism distinguish between necessary desire and unnecessary desire
> This is rooted in the Greek philosophical concepts of **nature (physis)** and **convention (nomos)**
> - [[Nature (Physis) vs. Convention (Nomos)]]

> Cynics distinguish between **necessary desires** (出於自然) which, if not met, would lead to death or inability to survive (e.g., needing shelter, need food), and **unnecessary desires** (不必要的需求) which arise from convention

> [[Diogenes]] believed a wise person should only satisfy natural desires, thereby **reducing their desires to a natural level** (把自己的慾望降抵倒自然的水平). This leads to a sense of unconstrained freedom

## What it enable us:
> Cynics sought a **state of freedom and ease** (自由自在的狀態) by rejecting the pursuit of wealth and fame, which are unnecessary desires

> Their happiness is **self-sufficient** (自足), not dependent on others' evaluations or external validation. 
> Diogenes' act of public masturbation is cited as an extreme example of his self-sufficiency, indicating that he would <u>never trouble others</u> for his needs

> Cynics advocate a "return to nature" (回歸自然), which also means **returning to one's true self or "original heart"** (回歸本心). 
> <u>The Greek word physis means both "nature" and "innate character". </u>
> Living according to one's true thoughts and actions, without pretense or hypocrisy, allows one to break free from worldly constraints and live freely

## 💭 My Reflection？
I dont really agree, because the human is a spices that became great because of we are a social spices. 
Nature != Good
I dont think Cynics sought a **state of freedom and ease** because in my opinion, a freedom state should be a state where people can choose either to accept or not to accept partial human culture (since we born as a human)

How you define  **one's true self or "original heart"**?
there's no definition,
