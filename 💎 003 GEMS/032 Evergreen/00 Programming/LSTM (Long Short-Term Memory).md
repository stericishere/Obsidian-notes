# LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
![[Pasted image 20250722030128.png]]

## <u>Main points:</u>
<u>For what data?</u>
> -
<u>What's special about it?</u>
> - Specialized RNN architecture  
> - Designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequence data
> - Uses gates (input, forget, output) to manage memory cell state
<u>What task it suitable for?</u>
> - Popular in time series, NLP, speech recognition, and more

## Extended explanation:
> -  LSTM networks were introduced to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs, especially the inability to remember information over long sequences. 
> 	- [[Gradient vanishing & exploding]]
> - LSTMs use a cell state that runs through the entire chain, with gates regulating the flow of information. This makes them highly effective for tasks where context and order matter, such as language modeling, translation, and financial forecasting.
