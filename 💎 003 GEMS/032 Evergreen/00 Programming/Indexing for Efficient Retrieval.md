# Indexing for Efficient Retrieval
## <u>Main points:</u>
> To efficiently find data, an **index** is necessary. It serves as additional metadata that acts as a signpost to locate desired data, though maintaining it incurs overhead, especially on writes. Different indexing structures like **B-trees** and **LSM-trees** offer distinct performance characteristics and trade-offs
