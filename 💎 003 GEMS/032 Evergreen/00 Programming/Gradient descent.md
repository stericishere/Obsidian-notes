# Gradient descent:
what is Gradient descent
> Gradient descent is a optimization technical that are used to find a minimal of our lose function. 
<u>What is and how to find gradient</u>
> First of all, Gradient tells us the direction of the steepest descent that we can take
> More specifically the gradient can be calculated by taking the derivative of the loss function with respect to the parameters 
<u>what the gradient represent and how it affect our training </u>
> So then we can use it to update our parameters in the steepest direction and
> use learning rate as a magnitude for us to descent
> Most importantly, Gradient descent allow us <u>take gradual steps</u> towards the minimal, so we can ensure model doesnt overshoot the optimal solution.
