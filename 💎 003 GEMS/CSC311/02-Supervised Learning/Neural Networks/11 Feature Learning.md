## Feature Learning:
- Transforming **high-dimensional input data into a lower-dimensional space**
- A space that is more easily manipulated or visualized
<u><span style="background:#d2cbff">Core principle:</span></u>
1. Learn meaningful features or underlying patterns directly from the data
2. **Dimensionality reduction**
	Saving computational resources and memory
	Mitigating [[Overfitting]]
	Enhancing [[Generalization]]
3. Extracting valuable **abstract feature** from **unlabeled data**
