## Transformation
- The vector moves to its closest point on the subspace![[Screenshot 2025-08-21 at 00.13.48.png|352x264]]
- A Projection Matrix move/project every vector outside of subspace, onto the [[subspace]] 
- (it can be a line, plane... depends on the dimenstion)

In this case the subspace is a line, and all the point outside of subspace is projected onto the line
