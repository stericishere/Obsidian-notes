## PC1
Basically PC1 is the direction in feature space where the data varies the most
- PC1 is the eigenvector with the **largest** eigenvalue.
$$v_1 \;=\; \arg\max_{\|v\| = 1} \; \text{Var}(Xv)$$
## PC2
By a Orthogonal PC2 we can find the second direction that perpendicular to our PC1
we want to minimize the distance from orgin to the projected point on PC1
